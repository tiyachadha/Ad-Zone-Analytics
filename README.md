Project Summary:
Retail stores have faced significant revenue decline due to e-commerce, where competitive pricing driven by a high number of advertisers attracts customers. To address this, I propose a solution to boost retail revenue by leveraging AI to identify "hotspots" — areas with the highest footfall in stores — and enabling dynamic pricing for advertisers and product placements.
This system uses AI-driven heatmaps and footfall analysis to determine optimal product placement and advertising locations, maximizing customer engagement and revenue generation.
